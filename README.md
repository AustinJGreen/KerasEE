## KerasEE
Keras machine learning library applied to Everybody Edits. Here I'm just experimenting with data from user worlds and
its potential to create interesting things.

## Auto Encoder
One part of this project is aimed towards training an auto encoder. This model is useful for other models as the auto
encoder learns features of worlds quite well.
