# KerasEE
Keras machine learning library applied to Everybody Edits. Here I'm just experimenting with data from user worlds and
its potential to create interesting things.

## World Auto Encoder
One part of this project is aimed towards training an auto encoder. This model is useful for other models as the auto
encoder learns features of worlds quite well.

## World Generater
One of the more challenging prospects I've had in mind is to be able to generate seemingly good small portions of worlds.
As of the current state of the project, I've been generating samples up to 64x64 in size. In order to generate worlds
even close to a regular 200x200 world like 256x256 or even 128x128 I would need more memory on my machine.
